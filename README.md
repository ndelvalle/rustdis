# rustdis

Welcome to rustdis, a partial Redis server implementation written in Rust.

This project came to life out of pure curiosity, and because we wanted to learn more about Rust and Redis. So doing this project seemed like a good idea.
The primary goal of rustdis is to offer a straightforward and comprehensible implementation, with no optimization techniques to ensure the code remains accessible and easy to understand.
As of now, rustdis focuses exclusively on implementing Redis' String data type and its associated methods. You can find more about Redis strings here: [Redis Strings](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/strings/).

This server is not production-ready; it is intended purely for educational purposes.
